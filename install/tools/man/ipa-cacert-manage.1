.TP
\fBrenew\fR
\- Renew the IPA CA certificate
.sp
.RS
This command can be used to manually renew CA certificate of the IPA CA.
.sp
When the IPA CA is the root CA (the default), it is not usually necessary to manually renew the CA certificate, as it will be renewed automatically when it is about to expire, but you can do so if you wish.
.sp
When the IPA CA is subordinate of an external CA, the renewal process involves submitting a CSR to the external CA and installing the newly issued certificate in IPA, which cannot be done automatically. It is necessary to manually renew the CA certificate in this setup.
.sp
When the IPA CA is not configured, this command is not available.
