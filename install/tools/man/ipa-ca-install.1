.SH "NAME"
ipa\-ca\-install \- Install a CA on a server
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-ca\-install [\fIOPTION\fR]... [replica_file]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Adds a CA as an IPA\-managed service. This requires that the IPA server is already installed and configured.

The replica_file is created using the ipa\-replica\-prepare utility and should be the same one used when originally installing the replica.

Alternatively, you can run ipa\-ca\-install without replica_file to upgrade from CA-less to CA-full.
