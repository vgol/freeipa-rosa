.TH "ipa-test-config" "1" "Aug 29 2013" "FreeIPA" "FreeIPA Manual Pages"
.SH "NAME"
ipa\-test\-config \- Generate FreeIPA test configuration for use in Bash scripts
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-test\-config [options]
.br
ipa\-test\-config [options] --global
.br
ipa\-test\-config [options] hostname
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The FreeIPA integration test suite is configured by setting environment
variables.
The ipa\-run\-tests command reads these variables and prints detailed
configuration for shell-based scripts to standard output.
The default output of ipa\-run\-tests consists of export statements that can be
sourced by Bash.

If run without arguments, it prints out configuration specific to the local
host.
Another host may be specified as an argument, or via the \-\-master,
\-\-replica, and \-\-client options.
With the --global option, it prints only configuration that is not specific to
any host.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print out the command's usage and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-global\fR
Output global configuration.
.TP
\fB\-\-domain\fR
Output configuration for the given domain (environment).
May be given as an index or name.
By default, domain 1 is used.
.TP
\fB\-\-master\fR
Output configuration for the master
.TP
\fB\-\-replica\fR
Output configuration for the replica with the given number
.TP
\fB\-\-replica\fR
Output configuration for the client with the given number
.TP
\fB\-\-role\fR
Output configuration for the host with the given role.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-simple\fR
Do not output Simple Vars.
These are normally included for backwards compatibility.
.TP
\fB\-\-yaml\fR
Output configuration in YAML format instead of Bash script.
This requires the PyYAML library to be installed.

    This requires the PyYAML library to be installed.

.TP
\fB$IPATEST_JSON_CONFIG\fR
    Specifies a file that contains configuration in JSON format,
    as given by \fBipa\-test\-config \-\-global \-\-json\fR.
    If given, the other environment variables are ignored.

    Domain is implicitly defined by _envX suffix of the environment variables,
    if either AD_envX or MASTER_envX is defined.

.TP
Host configuration:

.TP

    FQDN of the first IPA server
.TP
\fB$REPLICA\fR
    FQDNs of other IPA servers (space-separated)
