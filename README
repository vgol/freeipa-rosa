                               IPA Server

  Overview
  --------

  FreeIPA allows Linux administrators to centrally manage identity,
  authentication and access control aspects of Linux and UNIX systems
  by providing simple to install and use command line and web based
  managment tools.
  FreeIPA is built on top of well known Open Source components and standard
  protocols with a very strong focus on ease of management and automation
  of installation and configuration tasks.
  FreeIPA can seamlessly integrate into an Active Directory environment via
  cross-realm Kerberos trust or user synchronization.

  Benefits

  FreeIPA:
  * Allows all your users to access all the machines with the same credentials
    and security settings
  * Allows users to access personal files transparently from any machine in
    an authenticated and secure way
  * Uses an advanced grouping mechanism to restrict network access to services
    and files only to specific users
  * Allows central management of security mechanisms like passwords,
    SSH Public Keys, SUDO rules, Keytabs, Access Control Rules
  * Enables delegation of selected administrative tasks to other power users
  * Integrates into Active Directory environments
